# Art

I enjoy photography as well as creating art with code, you can find some of my work here:

import Image from "next/image"
import photography from "../public/images/photography.jpeg"
import creativeCoding from "../public/images/creative-coding.jpeg"

[<Image src={photography} alt="Photography" placeholder="blur"/>](https://works.shud.in)

<div style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>[Photography ↗](https://works.shud.in)</div>

And creative coding projects:

[<Image src={creativeCoding} alt="Creative Coding" placeholder="blur"/>](https://works.shud.in/creative-coding)

<div style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
  [Creative Coding ↗](https://works.shud.in/creative-coding)
</div>
